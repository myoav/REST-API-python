# REST-API-python
My first REST API !
This Backend part should support:
 - Insertion of a User to DB
    - USER { 
      *Key* ID,
            Nickname,
            Username,
            Password,
            Create_time,
            Status.
           }
           
- Return all users in a database

Implemented with Flask and json (see requirements.txt)
